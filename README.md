### **Greeneries** is a mod that enhances Minecraft’s flora, while staying true to vanilla’s aesthetic.

## About

We’re introducing new variations of existing plants, along with commonly found wild foliage, to bring greater depth and diversity to your once-uniform Minecraft world! Many of our new plants follow vanilla grass mechanics, so our mod won’t unnecessarily clutter your inventory, keeping gameplay smooth and unobtrusive whilst adding that extra touch of life to your landscapes.
